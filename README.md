A personal project makes your world a better place

---
Edit this **README.md** file. Write an outline of a project that you would be proud to work on. 

Use the **Wiki** (see the Wiki link in the navigation bar above) to create detailed specifications.

You don't have to think yet about _how_ to achieve the goals that you describe. You can simple focus on _what_ your goals are.

As you continue through the DCI course, think about how each new concept could help you achieve one or more of your goals.

Create different **branches** to experiment with ideas. Use each branch for a little "barebones" project that explores ways to provide a feature or a layout or a concept.

Change the **name of the repository** so that it reflects your purpose.

**Share the link** with your friends, your family, your fellow students. Talk about your ideas, your hopes, your successes.

Enjoy taking on a challenge that seems too big in the beginning, and gradually becomes realistic as your skills improve :
